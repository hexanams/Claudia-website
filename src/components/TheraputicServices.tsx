                    One-to-one talk therapy can offer you a safe space to help you navigate any difficulties you are experiencing and work through them in a supportive environment. Therapy can also be a space to offload and navigate lifeâ€™s challenges.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When it comes to psychological therapy for adults there is no one-size-fits-all. We all work in different ways and seek psychological support for our own unique reasons, which is why we provide an environment where we can develop tailored treatment approaches that meet your individual therapeutic needs and goals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whether this is your first time seeking therapy or you are returning to therapy our tailor-made approach to therapy will ensure we meet your needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We draw upon numerous psychological models including Person-Centred, Psychodynamic / Psychoanalytical therapy, Intensive Short Term Dynamic Therapy, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)and more in order to find the right approach for your needs.

                <p>We recognise that every individual is different and has their own individual experience that leads them to seek psychological therapy and couples therapy is no different.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are many reasons why couples choose to seek couples therapy, for example partners may notice unhelpful, repeating behaviour patterns which find them stuck in the same argument over and over again, some problems within relationships may arise due to lack of trust, intimacy or communication. There may also be external factors placing stress on the relationship such as financial problems or work stressors. When any of these problems arise within a relationship, couples therapy can help you to communicate more effectively and form a deeper understanding of one another.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I believe that couples therapy isn&apos;t just needed for when things are going wrong. In fact, seeking therapy during times when things are going well can be incredibly beneficial for strengthening the relationship and building a deeper connection. It&apos;s a proactive way to deepen communication, resolve any lingering issues before they escalate, and learn new tools for maintaining a healthy and supportive relationship. Therapy can help couples stay aligned with each other, navigate challenges that arise, and even improve intimacy and trust. I see it as a space to explore not only when there is difficulties but also a space to ensure you remain on a healthy path in your relationship as relationships take efforts, commitment and people evolve overtime which can create a disconnect.
